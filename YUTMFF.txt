• They use a 1-way infinite tape.

• The tape alphabet has two different special symbols, *blank* and *leftend* that are not part of the
input alphabet.

• Initially, if the input string is w, the tape contains *leftend*w at the left end of the tape,
and the rest of the tape contains only *blank* symbols. The head of the Turing machine is
initially positioned at the first character of the input string w (i.e., at the tape’s second
square).

• Whenever the Turing machine sees the *leftend* symbol, it must leave it unchanged and move
right (but it can change state).

We also make some naming conventions. We assume that the state set of the Turing
machine is Q = {q0, q1, . . . , qn−1} where n ≥ 3 and the tape alphabet of the Turing machine
is Γ = {c0, c1, . . . , cm−1} where m ≥ 3. We also assume that q0 is the initial state, qn−2 is
the accepting state and qn−1 is the rejecting state. We assume that the input alphabet is
Σ = {c0, c1, . . . , ck−1} where 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 2 and cm−2 = *blank* and cm−1 = *leftend*.

We now explain how to describe, using YUTMFF, a Turing machine that follows the
conventions described above. The first line of the file contains the three integers n, m, and
k, separated by single spaces. (Recall that these are the sizes of the state set, tape alphabet
and input alphabet, respectively.)
Each character in the tape alphabet has a name. The second line of the file contains m−2
strings separated by single spaces that give the names of the characters c0, c1, . . . , cm−3. We
use the name *blank* to represent cm−2 and *leftend* to represent cm−1.

The third line contains a non-negative integer T. Following this, there are T lines. Each of these remaining lines
of the description contains five items i, a, i0, a0, d separated by single spaces, where i and i0 are integers with
0 ≤ i ≤ n−3 and 0 ≤ i0 ≤ n − 1 (inclusive), a and a0 are names of characters in the tape alphabet and d is a single character
that is either L or R. This line indicates that δ(qi, a) = (qi0, a0, d). No two lines should have the same i and a.

Note that no transitions are given for situations when the machine is in state qn−2 or qn−1 since those are the
accepting and rejecting states. If no transition is given to describe δ(qi, a) for a non-halting state qi, then it is assumed that
δ(qi, a) = (qi, a, R).
