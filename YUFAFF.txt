York-University-Finite-Automaton-File-Format(YUFAFF)

The YUFAFF is a way to describe a finite automaton in a text file. It can be used for deterministic or non-deterministic automata.
Suppose you wish to describe an automaton (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F). We shall assume the state
names are q0, q1, . . . , qn−1, where q0 is the starting state. (If this is not the case, just rename the states.)

The first line of the file contains four positive integers n, m, k and t separated by single
spaces, where n = |Q|, m = |Σ|, k = |F| and t is the number of lines in the file that will be
used to describe transitions of the automaton.
The second line of the file contains m strings σ0, σ1, . . . , σm−1 separated by single spaces.
These strings are the names of the characters of the input alphabet. These strings should
be distinct and should not contain any spaces. Ordinarily, you will use single-character strings to name the characters,
but we allow strings more generally in case you want to talk about an automaton that
uses an alphabet of non-ASCII input characters. For example, if your input alphabet was
Σ = {α, β, γ}, you might use the names alpha beta gamma for the characters.
The third line contains k natural numbers separated by single spaces. These numbers
are the indices of the accepting states. For example, if the accepting states are q0, q6 and q9
then the third line of the file should contain 0 6 9.

The following t lines each contain the description of one transition defined by δ.
For deterministic finite automata, each of these t lines contains a natural number i, a
character name x and another natural number j, separated by single spaces. There should
be one line containing i x j if and only if δ(qi, x) = qj. The values should satisfy 0 ≤ i < n,
0 ≤ j < n, x ∈ {σ0, . . . , σm−1}. For deterministic finite automata, we should have t = mn.
For non-deterministic finite automata, each of the t lines contains a natural number i,
a string x and another natural number j, separated by single spaces. The string x should
either be a character name in {σ0, . . . , σm−1} or should be the string empty to indicate a
ε-transition. There should be one line containing i x j if and only if qj ∈ δ(qi, x).

Anything after these t lines will be ignored, so you can use them to write comments or
explanations.

Example: The deterministic automaton shown in Figure 1.14 of Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser could be
described as follows in YUFAFF:

2 2 1
Comment: This file describes the automaton in Figure 1.14 of the textbook.
