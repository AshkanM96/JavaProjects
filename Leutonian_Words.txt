Comments :

1. This file describes a finite automaton that accepts Leutonian words.
2. The Leutonian alphabet consists of the following four letters : a, b, m, o
3. Leutonian words must follow two rules which are as follows :
	i) Vowels(a, o) and consonants(b, m) must alternate.
	ii) An o can never appear later in the word than an a.

4. The states of the automaton, are as follows :

q0 is the empty string.
q1 is vowels where we have seen an a.
q2 is vowels where we haven't seen an a.
q3 is consonants where we have seen an a.
q4 is consonants where we haven't seen an a.
q5 is the fail state(the state it cannot leave after entering, since the string already contradicts one of the rules and as such the rest of the string doesn't affect the decision).
