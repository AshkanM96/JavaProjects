## TM-and-DFA-Compilers

This is just a repository of Turing-Machine and Deterministic-Finite-Automata Compilers.

*TMS.java* is a Turing-Machine compiler/simulator class that reads a description of a Turing-Machine specified by York-University-Turing-Machine-File-Format(YUTMFF for short). It can handle Turing-Machines with one-sided tapes(tape infinite on one end only as described in Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser http://math.mit.edu/~sipser/).

*TMSS.java* is similar to *TMS.java* with the minor difference that it can handle Turing-Machines with two-sided tapes (tape infinite on both ends).

*DFA.java* is a Deterministic-Finite-Automata(DFA for short) compiler/simulator class that read a description of a DFA specified by York-Unifersity-Finite-Automata-File-Format(YUFAFF for short).
